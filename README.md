# Combinatrix

Parser combinator library in rust. 

What is the return type of a parser?
    - Another Parser?
    - Result with another parser?

Where can generics be useful here?

Can i give a name to a return type that is a function?



c_repeat function

return matched values instead of the empty tuple
